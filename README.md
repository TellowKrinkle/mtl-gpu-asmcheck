# mtl-gpu-objdump
llvm-objdump linked against Apple's private GPUCompiler libLLVM.dylib
## Notes
Files are based off LLVM version 7.0.0.  Not exactly sure what version the actual thing is based off of, but it's missing some changes added to llvm 8, but also has some changes that weren't included in llvm 7 (upstreamed by Apple devs) so I'm guessing it's based off llvm 7
